# 🚛 **FleetFix – AI-Powered Vehicle Maintenance Predictor**

### ⚙️ *Smarter Fleets. Safer Roads. Lower Costs.*

---

## 📖 **About the Project**

**FleetFix** is an **AI/ML-based web solution** that predicts vehicle maintenance needs for logistics companies.

---

## 🎯 **Key Objectives**

- ✅ Reduce unexpected breakdowns  
- ✅ Lower repair & servicing costs  
- ✅ Enhance fleet safety & compliance  
- ✅ Support sustainable transport practices  
- ✅ Optimize resource usage and reduce emissions

---

## 🚩 **Problem Statement**

Frequent unplanned breakdowns and reactive maintenance cause high repair costs, safety risks, and operational delays. FleetFix uses **real-time vehicle data**, **maintenance history**, and **external factors** (GPS, weather) to predict maintenance needs *before* issues arise. This ensures timely servicing, lower costs, and safer operations.

---

## 💡 **Core Features**

- 🔔 Predictive maintenance alerts  
- 📡 Real-time vehicle data input  
- 🧾 Maintenance history tracking  
- 📍 GPS & weather integration  
- 📑 PDF/CSV report generation  
- 📊 Interactive dashboard & analytics  
- 🔒 Secure user registration & login

## 🧠 **How it Works**

**Model:** `Random Forest Classifier`

> **Why Random Forest?**  
> During our experimentation, we evaluated multiple machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), AdaBoost, and Decision Trees. After comparing their accuracy, robustness, and ease of interpretation, we finalized the **Random Forest Classifier** because:
>
> - It handles structured vehicle data efficiently  
> - Combines multiple decision trees to reduce overfitting  
> - Provides feature importance scores (e.g., mileage, brake health, tire condition)  
> - Performs reliably even with noisy or incomplete data

FleetFix continuously analyzes real-time and historical data to predict when and where maintenance is required.
